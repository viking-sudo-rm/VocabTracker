VocabTracker
============

A Python program for easily reviewing vocabulary in any language (built-in templates are Latin nouns and verbs).

To make a new template, go into the templates folder and make a new file. Follow the syntax used in the two existing templates.

Feel free to modify and hope you enjoy :)
